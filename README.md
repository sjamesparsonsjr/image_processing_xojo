# Image_processing-with-XOJO

Cell Eleven has hardware that is equipped with an 8MP camera with a 180Â° tilt feature.  Utilizing these images to ascertain data will improve functionality.  The application works with camera images to isolate distance, measurements, QR codes, and other image processing functions.
